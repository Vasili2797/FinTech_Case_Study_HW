## How FinTech, and in particular Robo-Advising, is changing the landscape in financial advisory
Overview and origin – the FinTech company that is in Robo-advising is called SoFi, which was founded in 2011 as an online refinancing company. Later on it branched into other services for affluent millennials, including mortgages, robo-advising, and life insurance. This company uses cutting-edge technology in FinTech to provide automated, algorithm-driven investment services with little amount of human interaction
Name of the Company- SoFi
When was the company incorporated? – 2011
Who are the founders of the company? – Mike Cagney, Ian Brady, James Finnigan, Dan Macklin
How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Sofi stands for Social Finance. The founders of SoFi in 2011 came to realization that the finance industry was not responding to the changing landscape of technology. With changes, people have new financial needs. With the advancement of technology, SoFi provided financial tool which can be used by people on their own smartphones to meet their financial needs, or even get approved for mortgage within minutes: something which required months of waiting.
How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company has been funded few times by different wealth funds. For example, in 2015, SoFi secured a one billion dollar funding in Series E funding with the help of Third Point Ventures and affiliates, Wellington Management Company LLP, RenRen, etc., In 2017 SoFi raised 500 million dollars in funding led by private equity firm Silver Lake.

## Business Activities
What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The company is trying to use computer algorithms to build and manage investment portfolios of their users. Furthermore, it helps facilitate the ability for people to receive funding, such as student loans, or even receive mortgage in as little time as possible, sometimes even receiving mortgage in as little as thirty minutes. Simply put, SoFi is trying to solve the difficulty of time lapse that comes when trying to receive fundings.
Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The company’s intended customers are the new generation that is tech savvy. Making college student loan applications fully online has given them the customer base all across the universities in the United States and beyond. The market size is huge since every year new and continuing students need funding to either start or continue education at their chosen university.
It’s user-friendly environment has helped SoFi get many customers. Furthermore, it uses more data analysis when making a decision on whether to lend money. For example, aside from looking at credit score and history of repayment, they also look at what school the borrower attended or is attending, what is their chosen field of study, etc. This helps SoFi become acquainted to students, who will most likely get mortgage in future, by using the same financing which has helped them finance their education in the past.
Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
They are currently using Python, Java MySQL, PostgreSQL, Jupyter, and many more of the technologies that are available in the technological world right now. 

What are the other major companies in this domain?
Weathfront, Betterment, SigFig, and many more corporations that are using cutting edge technology in fintech to help its customers make the best decision using robo advisors

## Results
What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Since this is a company that uses advanced algorithms to help its’ customers to make financial decisions using robo advising, this company has tremendously changed financial advising. Before robo advising, financial advisors used their previous knowledge to recommend thei customers what the next best step would be in achieving their financial needs. However, the industry is changing so fast that the advisors have difficulty helping out with tough decisions, which is exacerbated with the fast advancement in technology in every single domain of human lives. Robo advisor does what it can with the brand new technology to advice on the next best decision. It uses algorithms, not previous knowledge, to help with financial planning. And with the help of these algorithms, SoFi receives brand new important information about financial world and financial situations that will help its customers.  Simply put, SoFi will recommend based on the most recent news and algorithms, while a human financial advisor would use their previous old knowledge to make an advice.  It is a new way of thinking in financial advising.
What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
When going for Robo-advising, a customer must know what kinds of services it provides. Usually, portfolio management and asset allocation are services that come with every company. However, several robo-advisors offer tax-loss harvesting services, they offer tax optimization, and the list goes on.
When we go onto the SoFi home page and scroll to the bottom, one can see all the services that are offered through SoFi. They offer student loan refinancing, mortgages, mortgage refinance, SoFi Invest, and many more. From the metrics of determining a success of the company, one can argue that their advising team is really comprehensive. And since it offers so many financial services, it can be said that SoFi is trying to break into every possible aspect of financing.
## Recommendations
If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
	They offer so many different financial services that it would be difficult to suggest some new financial service offerings. Maybe one advice would be to start offering advising for everyone. The difficulty with robo advising is that robo advising is not for everyone. Unfortunately, this gap causes billions of dollars being lost on a service which the company already provides. So, it would be nice if they figure out ways to change algorithms to the point where robo advisors would be recommended for everyone, not just for the few, and the financial avising would be the thing of the past.

Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
If they start offering a better service for everyone, then the company would make billions of dollars and simply take away all the customers from financial advisors. The profits would skyrocket for the company. Although financial advising would be cheaper, compared to human financial advisors, it would still be making way more financial gains, since there would be more people paying for the services.
What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Since they would need more information to be more comprehensive advisors to everyone, they would most likely need more cloud service, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage service. It would store more data and help robo-advisors give better advice on different financial needs.

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Since SoFi and robo-advising in general uses algorithm driven investment services, I believe it would be appropriate to continue advancing the algorithm that they ustilize, as a consequence, they would need more complex algorithm to continue offering great service to their customers and help robo-advisors make decisions, as a result, utilizing Amazon Simple Storage Service would be great.
